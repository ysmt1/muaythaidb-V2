# muaythaidb-V2

Muay Thai DB is a web app created for users to create and review Muay Thai gyms in Thailand

With many hobbyists and professionals from all over the world traveling to Thailand to train this amazing martial art, I thought a centralized place for reviews would be helpful for people trying to choose a gym.

V1 - Built using Flask framework https://github.com/ysmt1/muaythaidb

Deployed on Heroku
