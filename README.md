# muaythaidb-V2

Muay Thai DB is a web app created for users to create and review Muay Thai gyms in Thailand

With many Nak Muay (practitioners) from all over the world traveling to Thailand to train, I thought a centralized place for reviews would be helpful for people trying to choose a gym.  

V1 - Built using Flask framework https://github.com/ysmt1/muaythaidb

V2 - Rebuilt with Django

Deployed on Heroku
